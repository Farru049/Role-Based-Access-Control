# Role-Based Access System

A powerful **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system designed to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The system allows administrators to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles, making it easy to define and enforce permissions for various users.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, view, and manage users.
- **Role Management**: Assign roles to users and define access levels.
- **Permission Management**: Set permissions for roles to control access to various resources.
- **Tab-based Navigation**: Seamlessly switch between Users, Roles, and Permissions, with tabs that are dynamically rendered based on user permissions.
- **Login System**: Secure authentication with role-based access on login.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices with a fully responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The frontend framework used for building the interactive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router**: For seamless page navigation.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for easy identification and UI enhancement.
- **Context API**: For managing authentication state and user permissions globally.
  
## Roles

The system includes multiple predefined roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to manage users, roles, and permissions.
- **Editor**: Limited access, can manage roles but not users or permissions.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access, can view users and roles.
