# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

A comprehensive **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system built with **React** that manages and restricts access to resources based on the user's role. This application allows users to have different access permissions, such as viewing, editing, and managing resources, depending on their assigned role (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
